# Simple-E-commerce-Inventory-Management-System-Java-
Business Challenge / Use Cases:
An e-commerce platform needs an inventory management system to keep track of its product inventory. The system should provide functionalities such as adding new products, updating stock counts, removing products, and checking available stock. It should be user-friendly and efficient, enabling seamless management of the inventory.

Proposed Solution:
We propose developing a simple inventory management system using Java. The system will provide a menu-driven interface to interact with the inventory and perform various operations. It will allow the user to add new products, update their stock counts, remove products from the inventory, and check the available stock for a specific product.

High-Level Architecture:
The high-level architecture of the inventory management system will consist of three main components:

Main class: Acts as the entry point for the program and handles the menu-driven interface.
Inventory class: Manages the product inventory, including adding, updating, removing, and checking stock for products.
Product class: Represents a product with its name and stock count.
Usage of GitHub Copilot:
GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, can be leveraged throughout the development process. It can help generate code snippets, suggest method implementations, handle edge cases, and improve overall code quality. By utilizing GitHub Copilot, we can accelerate the development process and ensure efficient and accurate implementation of the inventory management system.

By following this proposed solution and utilizing GitHub Copilot, we can create a user-friendly and effective inventory management system for the e-commerce platform.
